I'm floatin' high, don't talk to me
I'm rollin' high, don't bother me
So follow me, yeah, come and follow me
In the night streets, dim the lights, please

What the fuck they want? I'm drunk as hell
Fuck work today, I wanna get some tail
Damn my little nigga graduated, man, I wish him well Now there's no more breaking them pies
And making that bail for them scales
Step across that fence and that's your life
When I run that town, that whip about town size
Four chains, they hang on my neck, was dipped in that brown rice
You think something wrong 'cause your shit don't shine bright
But ain't nothing wrong 'cause your shit don't shine bright

I'm floatin' high, don't talk to me
I'm rollin' high, don't bother me
So follow me, yeah, come and follow me
In the night streets, dim the lights, please

It was Friday, what a night, what a situation
My nigga Chase momma called cause he missed that graduation
He told her, "Momma please, have a drink, have a little bit patience
'Cause soon we would be riding in a car with a little ventilation"
Pastor said that we gotta move to congregation
I'm looking for salvation, but I'm drowning in the revelations
XX revolution, this inauguration to the whole nation
If it ain't no head, no sex, then it's masturbation
