(Dean, what's poppin'? Yo, Travis)
Mhm, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Mama's bailing down that road, craving 9021...

She a porn star girl, ah, from the valley
(Honestly, God bless)
Who left her hometown world all for that alley
Oh, created Lake Tahoe all from her panties
(I hope it was wet like my jumper, though)
Ooh, used to take the long way home
Long way home, all for that candy, mm (Hahaha)

Jacques turned La Flame, now he rolling on an Addy
Fifty on a chain, 'nother fifty on a Caddy, oh
He might pop him a pill, pop him a seal, pop anyone
Pop anything, pop anything to find that alley
Hmm, yeah, to find that alley, mm

In the 90210, 90210, looking for that alley
In the 90210, 90210, looking for that alley, ooh
It's the superstar girl, superstar girl, roaming in that alley
Baby's hooked on feeling low
Oh, in the 90210, 90210, somewhere in that alley


Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
