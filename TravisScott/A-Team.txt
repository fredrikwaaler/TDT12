When I back off the curb
In back of the back, the Batmobile heard
I'm back on alert
I'm back, what's the word?
I'm back, what's the word?
I'm back in the third
They back on my mind, they back on my nerves
Can't take back the time so I'm back, back, back spending
I'm back on the splurge, I'm back on the splurge
They jump when I jump out then jump in and swerve, swerve, yeah, yeah

Can't be from New Jersey how you throw back
