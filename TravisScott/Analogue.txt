The stars are out tonight
Let 'em fall over you
If I run away tonight
I blame it all on you
And we party every night
And I blame it all on you

And we party every night
And I blame it all on you
The stars are out tonight
Let 'em fall over you
If I run away tonight
I’ll blame it all on you
And we party every night
And I blame it all on you
And I blame it all on you
And I blame it all on you
And we party every night
And I blame it all on you

Sweet winter, got head before my dinner
Scream by the half and now we in the mirror
Around this time tonight, niggas is niggas
So we gon' hit the town tonight, roll up the killa
There go my soul, you get the picture
Holy grail filled with wine to pass time
What I fantasize in due time that come alive
And we just pray to god we all be still alive
And we so fly tonight
Hope a nigga touch the sky tonight

And the stars is out so bright
Let 'em shine over you
And we dance across tonight
I blame it all on you

Shut the lights down when I’m in the place
The time is right now, feelin' out of space
It’s like '99, whatever happened to Ma$e
Gotta make it ahead of time like hookers in a race
We gon' shine before they hate us
Eat before the waiters, now more than ever
