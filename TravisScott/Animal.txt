I'm floating from the ground
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
From the ground
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
From the ground

We lost in the world who's feeling safe
It's parked outside been in the case
We walk outside feel like a mason
The preacher at the altar to tell you to have a taste
White wine, go ahead and sip your race
And walk in the closet and feel amazed
Ain't no retire, fall out of line and we get to pacin
And we gonna simply reside and fill up the space and
Took the travis may leave you around and place it
That's a classic, no other way to have it
Remember me and my brother slept on that mattress
And look how many bitches piled up on that mattress
I'm feeling too proud, cause all my niggas around
I gotta prove it right now waitin' for â€˜em to feel it
It was cool for a second, but now might take a minute
Cause now I'm in the building, god damn, I'm about to kill it

I'm floating from the ground
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
From the ground
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
From the ground

I'm floating from the ground
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
From the ground
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
From the ground

Had to leave from home, better off than hell
Skip the town somehow I ended up in jail
Loved the jail, it was better in the cell
Did a little crime, too that shit never ever tell
Somewhat I'm partying the third partying
First she started gargling, and end up swallowing
And went to class too and got some knowledge
You fucking with the devil like she over popping him
She love the pills too she over popping em'
She's standing in the line, just to do the line
Fuck is that fresher than a motherfucker
Tell me wanna fuck with us
Frontline hands up, niggas while we thrown dust
