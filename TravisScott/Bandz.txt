I got bands (Oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Don't need these hoes, hundred racks to blow
Nigga, I got bands (Oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Let's get this dough, run the world for sure
I got bands

Man, I'm in these streets, it's been a long day
'Bout to sign this deal and throw it all away
'Bout to cop the crib that Dame lost today
Funny look at them niggas that slippin'
You trippin', no fear, my niggas, we get it
I'm looking down at the whole world through these glass ceilings
And when I step outside bad bitches with me
Back in my section twisting that la la, can't let it stress me
Wake up, fall asleep to Dizzy Gillespie
Ba-back it up and break it down
She gon' bust it on this dick you gon' take her out of town
I put ice in my veneers, I put rubies in my crown
Count them stacks and blow them racks, niggas know who they around

I got bands (Oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Don't need these hoes, hundred racks to blow
Nigga, I got bands (Oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Let's get this dough, run the world for sure
I got bands (Oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Don't need these hoes, hundred racks to blow
Nigga, I got bands (Oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Let's get this dough, run the world for sure
I got bands

I got bands (Oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Don't need these hoes, hundred racks to blow
Nigga, I got bands (Oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Let's get this dough, run the world for sure
I got bands (Oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Don't need these hoes, hundred racks to blow
Nigga, I got bands (Oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Let's get this dough, run the world for sure
I got bands

(Ooooh, I know you bitch niggas hate me now)
I got bands, I got bands, I got bands, I got bands, I got bands
(Ooooh, I know you bitch niggas hate me now)
I got bands, I got bands, I got bands, I got bands, I got bands
(Ooooh, I know you bitch niggas hate me now)
I got bands, I got bands, I got bands, I got bands, I got bands
(Ooooh, I know you bitch niggas hate me now)
I got bands, I got bands, I got bands, I got bands, I got bands

Lately, I been goin' crazy
Laughin', drinkin', find myself in arms of different women, huh
Toast it, I need to use my cerebellum
Tried to tell 'em cut that rap shit all that wack shit is underwhelming
Time's ticking, palms itching
Minds tripping, tired of living, mad decisions, I'll kill 'em
(Ooooh, I know you bitch niggas hate me now)
I got bands, I got bands, I got bands, I got bands, I got bands
