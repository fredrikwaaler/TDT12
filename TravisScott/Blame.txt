Who to blame? Who to trust? Who to love?
I been layin' on the rough
Tryin' drugs for a month
Hopin' it'd keep me up

No, this is not a bluff
Too late to make me change
I been feelin' like a castaway (Yeah)
Sittin' waitin' on your page
That you 'bout to pull up to the cave
Then we practice fifty shades of grey
Beatin', punchin' on the grain
Bloody knuckles, I been sippin' muddy
I'm so numb now 'til the run-around
Are you sendin' me? Are you comin' now?
'Cause I know, soon, I'll be comin' down
I'll be comin' down, I'll be comin' down
Darker, darker in the back of the night
I been rollin', rollin', I been feelin' so nice
I been got it, got it, got it, feelin' so right
Windin', windin', why'd you wind it so tight?
I been runnin' from my face, so precise
I didn't get it, got me happed in my ride
I just run up on and smashin' the side
They're the counts, I been all in my city
My state of mind, I been feelin' so gritty
And I, man, I, no-no-no, my nigga
I know-know, my nigga, I know-know, my nigga
You know?

Who to blame? Who to trust? Who to love?
I been layin' on the rough
Tryin' drugs for a month
Hopin' it'd get me up

Hopin' it'd make a change
Trade the bus for a Range
Do that shit any day, they trade the game for they chain
I been feelin', feel ashamed, yeah

Who to blame? Who to trust? Who to love?
I been layin' on the rough
Tryin' drugs for a month, yeah
Hopin' that'd keep me up, yeah

Never bein' up, yeah
I been rollin' in a cup, yeah
Rollin', rollin', in enough, yeah
Rollin', don't you call my bluff, yeah
Shooter shootin' at me, uh, yeah
Shooters, shooters stick you up, yeah

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, yeah
