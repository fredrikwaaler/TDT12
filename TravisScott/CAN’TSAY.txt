No, you can't say if I'm mad or not
Smokin' hella weed, I'm on that alcohol
Shawty lick me clean the way she suck me off
I keep two hoes in my bed, I got 'em turnin' out
What would you do if you heard I got it goin' on?
I had to burn, I left "skrrt" marks, I had to dip (I had to)
Gotta watch for 12 'round my town, you might get killed (Better watch for 12)
I'm out my mind, yeah, I'm high above the rim (I'm out my mind)
You cop it live, boy, I got it all on film

You gotta watch out where you rock 'cause shit get real
Drink too real, I can't be fake, don't know the feel
Gotta take a long drive up the hill
Gang too wavy, move like Navy Seals
I'm too wavy, think I need a Lyft
Chicago baby, she just wanna drill
The vibe's too wavy, it's too hard to kill
Gotta watch out where you go 'cause shit get real
