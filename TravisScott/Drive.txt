10-201, you know what I'm sayin'?
Smokin' big, drankin' syrup, know what I'm talkin' 'bout?


What, sucker free, what, what
I can do dat (I can do dat right there)
I can do dat, ay

It don't matter cause I buy me some more - I can do dat
I'ma spend about fifty in the mall - I can do dat
I'ma buy me a Bentley in the fall - I can do dat
I'ma stop weak niggas from rappin'...


I, can't, leave, drank alone
It got me feenin' (Feenin', feelin' good, Feelin' like a boss as I'm creeping through my hood)

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Feel like I'm on the drive to the moon
Man I thought the world was ending soon
Damn, the devil stay testin' and the devil wear Prada
(Just tryna go up the avenue)

Whether I'm shinin' all winter or chillin' all summer
We rockin' furs, look like I copped 'em straight out the jungle
Used to spend cheese up on the steez, yeah I remember
Used to take trips whippin' the Jeep that my mom loaned us
Ridin' real slow
Mmhm, that's the shit they didn't know
Cruisin' down 59 seeing niggas ridin' fours, I just stared at the stars
And looked with my eyes closed 'cause it's driving me wild

Hit the weed and just drive
Hit the weed and just drive
Hit the weed and just drive
Hit the weed and just drive, oh, yeah
