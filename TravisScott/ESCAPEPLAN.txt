Ah, Cactus

Twelve figure state plan, that was the escape plan
But hate investigatin', that shit was a waistband
But wait, I stopped the facin' 'cause shit just start erasin'
But wait, it opened gates and this shit just start paradin', olé
We out the basement, on one floor where it's vacant
She feelin' anxious to be out where it's dangerous, okay
Love all the chains and especially how I bang it, okay
Jamaica-Spanglish, she mixed up in her language, hey bae

That wap need draining, just have it if you singing, okay
Fuck that Birkin, she just need some еncouragement
Fix that attitude, shе think she need a surgeon, okay
And show some gratitude, I put you in that altitude, okay
They stunt like Mannis do, I put you in that magnitude, oh, hey
I embrace the pussy, I'm not tryna embarrass you
Okay, I got a lavish crew, me, Chase the rocker the day did you
Business trapper, I'm not a rapper, a lot I do, a lot at you
I filmed, directed, Helter Skelter, off the seltzer like it's juice

Twelve figure state plan, that was the escape plan
But hate investigatin', that shit was a waistband
But wait, I stopped the facin' 'cause shit just start erasin'
But wait, it opened gates and this shit just start paradin', olé
We out the basement, on one floor where it's vacant
She feelin' anxious to be out where it's dangerous, okay
Love all the chains and especially how I bang it, okay
Jamaica-Spanglish, she mixed up in her language, hey bae

Niggas dyin' for the chain around my neck, it's like the lake
All my niggas like to lurk
I be tryin' not to go back in my ways, I can't revert
