Never said it's easy, was never easy (Yahh)
Made it out the greasy, made it look easy (Yahh)
Never said it's easy, was never easy (Yahh)
Made it out the greasy, made it look easy (Yeah, yeah)
I been on the lean and I been up dreamin' (Straight up)
Never said it's easy, was never easy (Straight up)
Made it out the greasy, made it look easy (Yeah, yeah)
Never said it's easy, was never ea–

Poppin', my shit is poppin', I get it [?]
Talkin', do too much talkin', I get a hundred
Notes, I gotta know, raisin' an octave
Bodies, I'm droppin' bodies, you better chug it
Shh, chh, lose it

Never said it's easy, was never easy (Yahh)
Made it out the greasy, made it look easy (Yahh)
Never said it's easy, was never easy (Yahh)
Made it out the greasy, made it look easy (Yeah, yeah)
I been on the lean and I been up dreamin' (Straight up)
Never said it's easy, was never easy (Straight up)
Made it out the greasy, made it look easy (Yeah, yeah)
Never said it's easy, was never easy (Yahh)

Gotta watch these hoes, yeah, these hoes be sleazy (Oh, yeah)
Had to drop my old bitch, that ho was sneaky (Oh, yeah)
Put that on my tongue, that shit got me tweakin'
Let's just have some–
Thaw that bih, thaw that bih, thaw that bih
Raw that bih, raw that bih, raw that bih
Stroke that ho, stroke that ho a lil' bit, yeah, on a pole
Work that ass a lil' bit, yah, yah, yah
I been on the road, I been in the TV
I just need some head, got some head, no reason
We been on a roll, countin' money, geekin'
She-she-she-she-she, she molly geekin'
She think she peaked, yeah, yeah
