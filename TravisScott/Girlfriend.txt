Time and time again, I been wonderin'
If  I should put up with this shit
Is  this bitch worth all the stress?
Say she really loves me, but don't wanna trust me
Always with the arguin', enough with all the promises
Been  on my nerves all day, girl, why you trippin'?
Fuck  is you doin', are you even listenin'?
Girl, get it together (Yeah)
I'm  trynna live on another level (Nah, nah)
You can't come with me if you keep whinin'
About shit that doesn't matter at all
What if I told you I don't care if you bawl?
I  ain't got the time for no idiot talk
I guess that's where I end this call

I told my conscience that this is the end
And it said, "No, no way, how did it get this way?"
I told my conscience that this is the end
And it said, "No, no way, you cannot go today"
