This that God feelin', mirage feelin'
Money shower feelin', praise the lord
Blaze to peace, oh, yes Lord
This that God feelin', ménage feelin'
Money showers, praise the lord
Blaze to peace, oh, yes Lord

Guess what? I ain't eat today or pay my rent today
I done fucked around and lost my mind doin' what the teacher say
Every night ,every other weekend, fuck, I needed that place to stay
Wonder if a nigga ever see that day, will a nigga ever get the beats on 'Ye?
Floatin' in my mind, thinkin' preparate for hell season, Jesus
You gon need Monisha, need Bonqui for different reasons, ugh
Damn, I want it all, swear to God this shit prestigious
One call done changed it all, La Flame holla, shout out to Regis
Guess what, I can tip today and pay your rent today
Fuck it, you can keep that fish fillet I'm eating creme brulee
We gon run this whole world, remember I had no shoes to lace
Now it's papasote, yeah, we far from that Kool-Aid
I just got back from Paris, I just been across the lake
Dad call seen me on XXL and yeen know what to say
Really though, nigga
They finally know kid been about it
No fiction about it, designer ,he bought it
Ain’t nothing different about it
We coming right in and ain’t leaving without it
Jack and Jill started fuckin' on my hill
Walk on water falls, they got back for raps and back to seal
World full of rage nigga, who gon' stop that now?
Price on that pussy is up to pull them panties down

This that God feelin', mirage feelin'
Money shower feelin', praise the lord
Blaze to peace, oh, yes Lord
