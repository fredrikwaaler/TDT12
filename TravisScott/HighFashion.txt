Maison Margiela blunts (Yeah), Louis Vuitton double cups (Yeah)
Designer drugs, you get seamed up if it tastes cut
Niggas rollin' like rollers, might roll up in dun-ta-dun (Straight up)
Don't think that I've had enough (La Flame!)
Cause I been on the binge
Scored a coke model, that's a high fashion win
Splurgin' in the mall got me spendin' all my ends
Yeah, we made it to the hills now (Straight up)
Coke costs a couple bills now
Yeah, tell me how it feels now
Tired of motherfuckers wanna be trill
Yeah, down south, it get real
Diamonds two steppin' every time I crack the grill
Niggas still hate hatin' niggas how I live

See how y'all at me? You see how they at me? (We see y'all niggas)
They tryna catch me, tryna snatch shit (We see y'all niggas)
Fly and flashy, say I'm fashion (Yeah)
I'm high fashion, I'm on acid
I move like I'm on acid, and I'm high fashion
I do it real drastic, I do it real drastic
Everything everlasting, money stretch like elastic
Oh, oh, oh, and I'm strapped with that plastic
And I'm strapped with that plastic
Fly and flashy, fly and flashy
Fly and flashy, oh, oh, oh
