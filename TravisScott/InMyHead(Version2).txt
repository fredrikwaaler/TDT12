You can crawl in my bed tonight
Long as you call ahead of time
I don't mind
Just need the time
I don't bite

You like the, like the brothers
I light them off of each other
I make them off if they've ever
I put the vibe in the thunder, yeah-yeah
She like to get together
Pinkie ring all of a sudden
I'm known to keep it right of a sudden
She got the figure all of a sudden

You on the dancefloor, movin' silent
Movin' through your town and the violence
Put a purple rain in, it sends you climbin'
Just a taste'll make everything vibrant
Wanna look out for the sirens and the tyrants
'Cause everything's a little too quiet
Something's 'bout to pop up out of hidin'
I can see the darkness in your eyelids

We downin' all the uppers (Uppers)
Then go down on each other (Yeah)
I put the vibe under covers (Yeah)
And gave her time to recover, yeah-yeah
You hear the sirens, it's trouble (Ooh-ooh)
You really wanna ride with a rebel (Ride)
'Cause you know I smoke the fire of the Devil (Yeah)
You wanna bring this loud through the ghetto

You wanna tiptoe, move in silence (Skrrt, skrrt)
Movin' through your town and the violence
Put a purple rain in, it sends you climbin'
Just to taste'll make everything vibrant (It's lit)
Wanna look out for the sirens and the tyrants
'Cause everything's a little too quiet (Yeah)
Something's 'bout to pop up out of hidin' (Yeah, yeah)
I can see the darkness in your eyelids

Movin' through the clouds like I'm lightnin'
'Bout to pop up on these niggas, make it frightenin'
Why you outside, are you not in?
'Cause I built a movie scene and a drive-in
Jewelers set ya Cubans so you shinin'
I can't bust down all my time to fit a diamond
In a public place showin' privates
I can see the darkness in your eyelids
