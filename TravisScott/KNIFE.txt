Russian roulette, blushin' brunette
Tell me what she did it for, was it for everything and more?
Chain so long it touched the boy, your fate prolonged until I'm bored
So much fun I'm overboard, you see just how they did the kid
Got a tip, they took the masses up the ladder, ain't that some shit?
Buy a pack and take a trip, travel late, we got the chips
Shit get gully and shit get ugly, but I know you not gon' flip
Plenty of nights I seen you spaz
Took 'em on the road, they chased my ass
.32 humble, OJ half
I done ran blocks likе OJ did
Said you was down but I know you flip
You a backstabber like a OJ hit, yeah
Takе the knife out of my back
