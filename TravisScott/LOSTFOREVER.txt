Lost on islands, driven in boat cars
Just bring your girl, feel like she both ours
Young black nigga work at the Auchans
So how we here trapped on the ocean?
'Bout to go up a level of disrespectful
I'm just one chain away from goin' heavy metal
I'm just one angel away from blockin' out the devil
Just one mountain away from meetin' all my rebels
Too much power, too many hours all in a day
I sent her flowers, ain't talkin roses, I'm talkin' maoda
Ask if she "Ha-ha-ha" I really doubt it (Ha-ha-ha)
Took her through the Hills at noon, she felt the... (And how wonderful, how wonderful)
Baby girl think she in Honolu' (Wonderful)
Don't you know you in the I-5 loop? (How wonderful)
How many chickens fit in the coupe? (How wonderful, wonderful)
Wonderful, she don't wanna leave
She jump up, bounce back like trampoline (How you are, forever)
