Left cheek, right cheek
Up top my suite
Don't stop, go girl
Long as you know who the one
Left cheek, right cheek
Up top my suite
Don’t stop, go girl
Long as you know who the one

Alright, alright
We 'bout to take off, sit tight
Link up, get right
Have my Velveeta, we'll have a good night, yeah
Tip her, tip her
It make her cum quicker, quicker
Havin’ you for dinner, dinner
Make me wanna put it in ya', in ya'

Left cheek, right cheek
Up top my suite
Don't stop, go girl
Long as you know who the one
Left cheek, right cheek
Up top my suite
Don't stop, go girl
Long as you know who the one
