At the highest that I ever be, yeah
Look through the clouds, you just see God and me, yeah
Goin' hard, that's the God in me

Pop like Aleve, help me relieve
You can tell by the chains, man, who runnin' things

Man, my bitch make me look good and they (Love it, mane)
Put La Flame on every hook 'cause they (Love it, mane)
