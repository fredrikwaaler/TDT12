What, what?
Mamacita, 'cita, 'cita
Woah-oh-oh, woah, woah-oh-oh
Mamacita, 'cita, 'cita
Woah-oh-oh, woah, woah-oh-oh

This the last days to the rodeo
Last night had me down in the back, comatose
Don't think sunshades and a pill gon' help
Once I'm gone, can't tame myself (Myself, myself)
Mamacita, 'cita, 'cita
You know I really need ya, need ya, need ya right now
She get freaky when the light's down
The shit's crack, no way niggas could pipe down
With the head first, got her straight out of the nightgown
Nothin' like the light-skinned mamacitas in H-Town
They got them pornstar big booties
Let me film it, then shoot it, 3D money, no illusion
Depending if I'm feelin' bougie, might hit your line, bitch

Had to cut my phone off, bitch got it vibratin' on me like a beeper (Brrr)
Boy, I'm in Colorado smokin' California reefer (Ha)
Hey, the bitch so bad, caught a ticket 'cause I really wanna meet her (Really wanna meet her, wanna meet her)
Hey, and I ain't kin to Wayne but that my mamacita
(Mamacita, mamacita, what? What?)
Hey, mamacita, mama, mama, my mamacita (Woo)
(Mamacita, 'cita, 'cita)
That's my, my mama, mamacita (Woo), that's my mama, mamacita (Woo)
That's my mama, mamacita (Racks), that's my mama, mamacita (What?)
(Mamacita, 'cita, 'cita)
That's my, that's my, mamacita, that's my, that's my mamacita
That's my—
