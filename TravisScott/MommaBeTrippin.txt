Man, man, man, momma be trippin'
See Tony got the Jeep and I'm ready to whip it
Chase packin' the techniques, and we rockin' the Key Club
Roll up the dub, club showin' us love
You know nobody givin' a fuck, can't fit in the truck
All my homies is here, so tell me who rollin' with us
From Chicago to Houston, to NY, yeah, we do this
We bumpin' the music, so get drunk and get stupid
You know nobody givin' a fuck 'bout (Last night)

Now-now-now throw your hands in the sky if you too fuckin' high to remember (Last night)
You only live one time so we gonna party tonight like (Last night)
Now-now-now throw your middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck about (Last night)
If you don't give a fuck about (If you don't give a fuck about)

Two twins and they naughty, they both ridin' shotty
It's a Friday and you know we ready to party
We hit the college in Malibu where it's hotties
They givin' us knowledge and while I'm drivin' they daddy's 'Raris
In the dark with no worries, we ain't in a hurry
I might just swerve and hit the curb (Skrrt)
We all too drunk to be scared (Skrrt)
Outta here, higher then the atmosphere
Yeah they ballin', but no Spalding
Make a killin', but no coffin
And when we make it, we gonna puke all over Vegas
And we were under the influence when we made this
So you gonna tell your DJ, "DJ, DJ, play this" (Last night)

Now-now-now throw your hands in the sky if you too fuckin' high to remember (Last night)
You only live one time so we gonna party tonight like (Last night)
Now-now-now throw your middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck about (Last night)
If you don't give a fuck about (If you don't give a fuck about)
Now-now-now throw your hands in the sky if you too fuckin' high to remember (Last night)
You only live one time so we gonna party tonight like (Last night)
Now-now-now throw your middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck about (Last night)
If you don't give a fuck about (If you don't give a fuck about)

It's the vendetta
No tarot cards, could tell me we trendsetters
Everybody out tonight, it couldn't have been better
Ain't nobody fight tonight except for the bartenders
We threw up our mom's dinner
So tell what you tryin' to do?
Me and my homies got the loot so we tryin' to boot
Her and her breast full off the booze, it's a party for two
Hotel room numbers and late night food runners
Summary of the whole summer, but can't seem to remember
From the fall of September, most of we can't remember
From the Spring to the Winter, couldn't tell you my dinner
Wish I could tell you what I did back in my past life
So how the hell you think I could tell you 'bout last night? (Last night)
