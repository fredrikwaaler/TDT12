Late night, scrollin' through my call log
Had too much to drink, so I called ya
We been on and off for a long time
How 'bout I come to your job and just spend time?
Damn, Goddamn, you always do it, damn
We get it at demand, got me thumbin' through them bands
I thank your momma for your damn features
Yo' ass on Pam, I swear I ain't lyin', Gina
Thought that we would never talk again
'Cause you always call me up at the wrong time

Everybody love me, baby (everybody love me, baby)
Can't nobody love me like you (ooh-ooh-oooh)
Everybody love you, baby (oooh-oooh-oooh)
Can't nobody love me like you (like you)

Baby, love, baby (know I need you), baby, you're my love
You always call me up at the wrong time (baby)
I be up late, obeying no signs, no (know that I need 'ya baby)
Won't you come over an' just roll mine? (yeah, baby)
I'ma mix somethin' for the long drive home
Baby, love, baby, baby, you're my love
Baby, love, baby, baby, you're my love

Wishin' I controlled time, wishin' I could do it
Wishin' for a long time just to set the mood in
We be goin' all night, but you just abusin'
Always had my phone line, but you never used it
Now you see me goin' up, now I'm glowin' up
I been, I been in that DB truck with my Courtney Love, ohh-oh

Everybody love me, baby (everybody love me, baby)
Can't nobody love me like you (like you)
Can only be you, can only be you
Everybody love me, baby (everybody love me, baby)
Can't nobody love me like you (like you)
