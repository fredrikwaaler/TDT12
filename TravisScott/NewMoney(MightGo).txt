Yeah, I'm up three, up three, check the news
Double cup and RÃ©my, that's the remedy for the blues
... yeah
We've been outside, we've been outside
Need to pull up to the crib for the stop by
29 I bust the line, no Rondo
Finna slide through, finna slide through
Yeah, don't make me come out just to find you
'Bout to make me go back to the low fade
