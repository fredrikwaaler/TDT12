Yeah, order more bottles, order more models
Order more hours, shots on an island
Hotter than the summer, the winter couldn't chill me
Young, free, and wildin', order more kidneys

Dope, I'm so dope
All these hunnies pilin' on the floor
And we stuntin', know you see the glow
Throw these hundreds, thought I'd let you know
Since LA, I've been puttin' on
Cirque du Soleil, goin' on and on
I got this money, tell me what you want
For this money, can you drop it low?

Yeah, order more bottles, order more models
Order more hours, shots on an island
Hotter than the summer, the winter couldn't chill me
Young, free, and wildin', order more kidneys
Mm, when the night calls, oh-oh-oh
When the night calls, oh-oh-oh
Yeah, order more bottles (Order more bottles)
Order more models (Order more models)
Order more hours (Order more hours)
Shots on an island (Shots on an island)
Hotter than the summer (Hotter than the summer)
The winter couldn't chill me (The winter couldn't chill me)
Young, free, and wildin' (Young, free, and wildin')
So order more kidneys (So order more kidneys)

Yeah, order more bottles (Order more bottles)
Order more models (Order more models)
Order more hours (Order more hours)
Shots on an island (Shots on an island)
Hotter than the summer (Hotter than the summer)
The winter couldn't chill me (The winter couldn't chill me)
Young, free, and wildin' (Young, free, and wildin')
So order more kidneys (So order more kidneys)

When the night crawls
All the money, all the hoes, and the alcohol
All these hundreds and these thousands, I'ma spend it all
Always when the night calls
When the night calls
We want money, we want hoes, we want alcohol
All these hundreds, all these thousands, I'ma spend it all
Always when the night calls
