Hey, I'm not allowed to do this, but does anyone have a cigarette?
A menthol cigarette? It's my birthday
I don't smoke cigarettes
I don't either, that's why I look so young
Cigs? It's her birthday
I think Jordan does
Or just, anything
Jordan?
Jordan?

Last call, last call for the weed and alcohol
Last call for you to slip out them drawers
Girl, I need it right now, get your ass in this stall
We ain't got time to stall
These niggas got me pissed off
Sippin' so long, girl, I'm pissin' Cristal
Sippin' and swervin'
My words don't know if I crashed into a pool or her jaw
Pops never home, left a long term
On the back when a lil' nigga had to sit and deal with it
Loner turned rock star, nigga, under the moon
Got the world in my palm, 'bout to rub her pussy with it
When you dominate it, come with digits
Let her see the Tempur-Pedic
Bend it over, beat it, skeet it
Then delete it, then repeat it
Then repeat it (Yeah) then she told me...
