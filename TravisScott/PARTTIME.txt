Part time, work at Sam's
Yeah she still work with her man
I can fall through, just no cams, yeah
White pills on my mans
I can't fall asleep, off Xans, under circumstance
Want me to fall off, can't go that easy
I can't fall off, I know they need me

Gang-gang just like fam
No new ones, can't take no chance, yeah
They know I'm legend, yeah

Don't look at me strange
I got so good with that aim, so good at takin' names
Somethin' 'bout this fame
I mean sometimes leave me drained, but so good, can't complain
Hundreds feel like ones, millions feel like thousands
Never see the sun, always see the night end

Gang-gang just like fam
No new ones, can't take no chance, yeah
They know I'm legend, yeah
