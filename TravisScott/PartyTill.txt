When I call, pick up, oh, yeah, you know the deal (Yeah)
You know T need to cop a feel on you
Then go David Copperfield on you (Ooh)
Know this a whole lot to put on you (Ooh)
So are you still awake (Yeah), still awake? (Yeah)
Here to take (Yeah) a stick I give away
Goin' up, away (It's lit), up, up and away
Pour me up my drink (Straight up), tell me how it taste
Hop in a coupe (Coupe), if there's nothing to do (Do)
Me and my boo, ooh, ooh
