(Used to, used to)
Used to ride around in the Mo, we kept that on the low
You was late night with the owl gettin' stacks on a roll, on a roll
You're so perfect, perfect
We was fightin', couldn't wait so we hit the side of the road

You're so per–, had it, bird
Damn it, I need it off dirt

[?] so much
