Us niggas, we can't behave
We mobbed on the pave, got treated like slaves
Young niggas treated like slaves
This the moment I've been waiting for
This why I moved to Cali, stepped outside and got shaded for
Told momma, "Bitch, get back in the door"
I've been comin' up and down, a nigga can't take no more
Kamikaze over commas
Benjamins, dividends stuffed in my jeans, I can't fit in
Poppin' pills since droppin' Ritalins
Pop a penicillin, nigga, you gotta get with it
My, my, my, my, look at little Scotty now
The same fuckers used to doubt
All preachin' that they proud
I pull my zipper down and whip it out
