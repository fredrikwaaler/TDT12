No monogamy, ménage with me
Pornography surrounding me
You get high with me, you come down with me
That's all I need in my fantasy
All these flashing lights—, lights—, lights—
Give you some of me, you want all of me
And get high with me and come down with me
Yeah, that's all I need in my fantasy

You remind me of my ex, crazy love
We designed our love around the drugs
We both in this club, we both tryna fuck
I'ma rub a dub, tryna get a nut

No monogamy, ménage with me
Pornography surrounding me
You get high with me, you come down with me
That's all I need in my fantasy
All these flashing lights blinding me
Give you some of me, you want all of me
And get high with me and come down with me
Yeah, that's all I need in my fantasy

Wake up, nigga, gotta get the cake up, nigga
Niggas in the bushes in the farms, might gotta rake up a nigga
I'm way too antsy 'cause my ambition's too frantic
I might need to move to Atlantis 'cause my mind too outlandish

It's the rodeo, time to get started
Houston nigga goin' James Harden
They was wildin' on us niggas in the projects
Wonder why a nigga went cold-hearted
They wanna put my soul up on an auction
But I'ma make 'em take the fall like August
And they gon' vote me right in on my caucus
And I'ma show these niggas how to get lawless
Why your hands out, asking could you hold one?
Who do I owe? Nigga, no one
They bigging you up but you low down
Animated acting frozen
I got porno pics, wish I can post them
Stackin' Franklins, I can't fold 'em
Niggas askin' for the old him
But I'm way too young to be the old him
I'ma make this shit crack Lamar Odom
'Til I climb to the top of the podium

So wake up, nigga, gotta get the cake up, nigga
Niggas in the bushes, niggas on the farm, might gotta rake up a nigga
I'm way too antsy 'cause my ambition's too frantic
I might move out to Atlantis 'cause my mind too outlandish
