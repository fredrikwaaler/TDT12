Pray for who lost they fate and died too young
Pray for the ones I hate, the ones I love
Pray for my liver when I'm off in this club
I pray that the demons go away, they hauntin' us
Man, I can't take no more of this lifestyle we been living
Man, I can't take no more of the white powers in position
Gotta grab up J-Will, gotta scoop up J-Rich
Told Chase we ain't going back, you know we gotta hitch
I mean, I'm aggravated, agitated, I admit
Intoxicated, animated, got me feeling kinda lit
Contemplating fornicating, might as well fuck up some shit
They looking at me way too crazy, got me feeling communist
But I'm just trying to save the throne, pray for Bones, pray for Stix (Just ask the lonely)
If my album never sell, then we gon' hit that lick
Tell Lamar, call up Cash, tell him buzz me at the Ritz (Just ask the lonely)
It's the weekend, we off the deep end, you need to pray for us

Pills (Pills, pills), have you ever been through life's (Through life's), challenges? Promises? Promises? (Challenges? Promises? Promises?)
Get down, I'm prayin' (Get down, I'm prayin')
Let me tell the lost tale about Jacques
Let me tell you how I turned Scott
How I went down on the block
Waterfall around ten o'clock
And how we came up getting all the knots, dodging cops, yeah
'Fore a nigga had the locks (Just ask the lonely)
'Fore a nigga had the chain, 'fore I had the bops
Always kept my city on me like it was a swatch (Just ask the lonely)
Every time we in the party, took it up a notch
Now I'm thinking 'bout this new girl, and she doing pop (Oh-oh)
Wanna know my dick longer than a Pringle box
(Don't pray for love)
Tired of seein' these black kids on the face of FOX (Oh-oh)
And fuck CNN, they don't wanna see us win (Say it loud)
Mama, don't you worry no, no more, worry no, no more (Just ask the lonely)
I'ma take you from the first to the ninetieth floor
You always told me what I plant, that shit gotta grow (Just ask the lonely)
And anything I detonate, that shit gotta blow
Pray for love

No, oh, oh (Woah)
We don't pray for love, no more, no more (Woah, woah, woah)
We don't wanna see you on the cover of a carton (You don't wanna see no more)
We don't wanna see you on the news (No more, no more, no more, no more), all alone
Hm, no, no, no, no, no, no, hm, no, no, no, no, no, no (Just ask the lonely)
Hm, no, no, no, no, no, no (Just ask the lonely)
Hm, no, no, no, no, yeah
