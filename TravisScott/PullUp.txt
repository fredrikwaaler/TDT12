Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Hilt for the shocker
Out the hilt, out the hilt, hilt
Out the, off the hilt
Drop it out the hilt, baby, drop it

On my dick, 38 hoes on my dick
Is it natural? Wide? Is it thick?
Checks in my pocket and my kicks, kicks
Took the risk, Rose-gold Patek on my wrist
If I pull up, pull up, is it lit?
Beepin' by the gate
I've been beepin' by the gate, I've been

Damn all these stars on my head
Okay, it's cool, keep this ice, keep me fresh
Chase hit the stu' with me, somethin' I can hear
You know I'm James in The Garden, I can't miss
Ooh-ooh, I been through it, let me vent
I sat back and watch 'em switch up from my side of the fence
Old niggas makin' rules, tryna box young Scotty in
Live and die just by two codes: love your haters; no new friends
Find a way to let it fade from me by the sip
Take it down 'til I feel it in my ribs
She come right through, then I send her to the crib
Then she know, now she know what it is, yeah
