Wake up in the mornin', throwin' on them Nikes
Runnin' through that check, shout my nigga Phil Knight
Oreos in Oregon State, pop twenty pills in the night (ooh)
Goin' a thousand miles in another state
They ain't oreos but they bright (straight up)
Clap it break that back, she just made a stack (ooh)
Niggas in that trap still totin' them straps (that dope)
If you make it where I'm from
It's like a lone star in the sky that's all black (Been Trill, motherfucker)
A 'ménage à trois' with black dykes, damn
That's the new civil rights (straight up)
Accidentally walked in the club, all these bitches bite (ooh)
Told my mama fuck a major, best decision my life (straight up)
Now niggas in the corridor, I'm velvet down to my corduroys (La Flame)
Got bottles by the cases, pussy by different races

Holy moly, all them niggas dead
All them pussies fed
Let 'em live? Meh
Young owl in the dark
Thought he'd make it, never
Do you hate 'cause they know I'ma be here forever (straight up)
Never fuck with the black and blue
Duck cause a nigga might shoot
Shocked what a nigga might do
Young nigga blessed like a nigga ah-choo (bless up)
In the Mo they smokin' raw diesel
Evil Knievel whip pullin' off in the dust (skrrt, skrrt!)
Throwin' flame rocks when a bitch might jerk (straight up)
Bouncin' this bitch like it's tennis
Rich and still eatin' at Denny's
Hotels phones, I'm talkin' that business
Came up with the ones that was with me
Besides, nigga, your niggas facade, nigga
She off shoe with that Snooki
Don't fall in love with that pussy (straight up)
