Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, ooh)
Feels like slow motion, we're floating at the speed (Yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)
Louder (Louder)
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher (Uhh, yeah)
It's like standing in the ocean

We just rocked Coachella, I gave her half of the check
It was good sex, honorable mention to the neck
(Just let this wash on me)
Didn't pass the loud, that was out of respect
Afterwards, pass the towel, I was out of Kleenex
If you take your girl out, do you expect sex?
If she take her titties out, do you expect checks?
First visit, I gave her a pearl necklace
(Just let this wash on me)
Next visit, I'ma need your girl naked
Took a church visit, you know, 'cause the world hectic
