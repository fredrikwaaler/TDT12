Rollin', rollin', rollin', got me stargazin' (Yeah)
Sippin' on purp, feelin' like the Barre Baby (It's lit)
Whatever I downed, it got me goin' crazy (Yah)
Psychedelics got me goin' crazy (Alright)

I was hot as hell out in the heat (Yeah, yeah)
Then a storm came in and saved my life
Head up to the sky, down on my knees (Straight up)
Out of nowhere, you came here to save the night
In the nighttime (Woo, yeah)

Rollin', rollin', rollin', got me stargazin' (Roll)
Psychedelics got me goin' crazy (Oh, no)
Niggas femalin', they excellin' (Yeah)

On tour, we'll tell 'em, we brought the section (Gang)
They keep on callin' up, it's getting hectic (Brrt)

So we cut the plug, he's interjected (Got me goin' crazy)

Rollin', rollin', rollin', got me stargazin' (Yeah)
Sippin' on purp, feelin' like the Barre Baby (It's lit)
Whatever I downed, it got me goin' crazy (Yah)
Psychedelics got me goin' crazy (Alright)

I was hot as hell out in the heat (Yeah, yeah)
Then the storm came in and saved my life
Head up to the sky, down on my knees (Straight up)
Out of nowhere, you came here to save the night
In the nighttime (Woo, yeah)

Got me goin' crazy
