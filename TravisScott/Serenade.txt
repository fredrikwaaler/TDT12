Red cups, my party hat on, you my party favor
Your trophy case filled with them accolades
When you leave, I just be hard as fuck
Hard as fuck, I'm tryna tell you somethin'

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
'Fore you go and have your parade
'Fore your sun turn black and grey
Come home, let me serenade ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Serenade ya (Yeah, yeah), 'fore you go and have your parade
'Fore your sun turn black and grey
Come home, let me serenade ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Serenade ya (Yeah, yeah), 'fore you go and have your parade
'Fore your sun turn black and grey
Come home, let me serenade ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Serenade ya (Yeah, yeah), 'fore you go and disobey
'Fore you let our love fade away, let's go back to our younger days
