Brrt, hello?
Migos, they know that I got it (Oh, straight up)
Know that my wristwatch is sloppy
Now they want a double dutch in my pockets (Straight up, yeah, yeah)
Tell me one thing, is you 'bout it? (Is you 'bout it?)
Girl, is you 'bout it? (Lil' bitty bitch, is you 'bout it?)
Gotta know before we let you tiptoe and run through the lobby (Run through the lobby, fuck is you sayin'?)
But the little bitty told me sloppy toppy was a hobby (Damn, damn, straight up)
So she gave me sloppy toppy like the sloppy toppy goddess (Like the sloppy toppy goddess, slop, slop)
Over the garden (Over the garden, slop)
Over the garden (Over the garden, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, what a goddess
On my province, we don't do massages (Straight up), just m√©nages (Oh)
She like to talk shit when we fuck, after she claims she forgot it (Straight up)
She don't tap out, no tap out, she'd rather just black out
Then we take trips to her trap house
We been pullin' them stacks out
Call over your friends, bend over, they poppin' for bands
Can't stop if I can
No, I do not do beer cans, fuck is this, frat house?

I know that she got it, Quavo know that she got it
Know that she got it
I know that she got it, I know that she got it (Quavo!)
