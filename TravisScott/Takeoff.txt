Honorable C.N.O.T.E

I'm on my spaceship, takeoff (Ooh-ooh)
(Space, takeoff, space, takeoff, space, takeoff)
I'm with the baddest in the city and she's out of this world (Ooh)
(Out of this world, she out of this world)
I must've died and went to Heaven (Ooh-ooh)
(Went to Heaven, went to Heaven, went to Heaven)
'Cause all I see is 'Raris, Lamborghinis and topless girls (Ooh)
(Topless girls, topless girls)

My life really is a highlight
My life turnin' to the day light
All the pretty girls wanna stay the night
Money, money, money, that's what they like
