Let the mink drag on the floor
She snorting the 70s dope
Up in the ghost she said she need it the most
Quit tripping we having a toast
Step in and out the plane
She act like she Marilyn Monroe
All on the boat showing her boobies the most
Lets toss her and see if she float
We pulled over the car at the liquor store
And if these bitches ain't fresh as me, then what we in here for?
Simply, That nigga wild, Let that nigga go
Easily, just roll up the dope and watch me turn it to smoke and go

Twenty to thirty trill hippies they circle around me
With skin leggings they rocking Marants, but they smoking for free
It's funny ain't it, bitches is destined to be
Living the dream, while you out chasing these hoes
She probably taste-testing my seeds

Ooooh, that's why we never sleep
It's primetime
When I'm on the phone I'm talking O's
So It's buy time
When I'm on the road turn the lights on
Cus' It's my shine
So all these strobe lights and bulb lights got me
