Up top, can't drop down
Told the homies, "Don't look around, it's just us now"

Up top, can't drop down
Told the homies, "Don't look around, it's just us now"
Got a Plain Jane, cost more than a bustdown

Let's be honest, shit I did on Ellen (Wait)
Bipolar Syndrome kickin' in off what I'm inhalin'
What he gon' do now? Ain't no tellin'
Six foot, on the money, I be 6'11" (Yeah)
Jumpin' out the three, man it's now or never
Never, never goin' home, never, never
What we did was off the record
Just had a deep thought in my cerebellum
Baby, wrist, ridin' round, we gon' take the risk
Ass and tits on 84s, that shit hard to miss
Call Teyana, told her I'ma need a Fade2Fit
I'ma break the club, bouncer make the membership
On a summer day, don't forget to bring the Haze
I'ma pull up where you stay, at my crib
Where you stay, where we at, no PDA
MMA for the dawgs, better days

Up top, can't drop down
Told the dawgs, "Don't look around, it's just us now"
Got a Plain Jane, cost more than a bustdown
