Pull out the zip, pull out the ride (Roll out)
We so high, upper echelon (Straight up)
We so fuckin' high, I'm upper echelon (Damn, La Flame, straight up!)
Pull out the zip, pull out the ride (Roll out, bando)
We so high, upper echelon (Bando, straight up)
We so fuckin' high, I'm upper echelon (Straight up, damn!)

Dozin' off them Xannies, just popped a bandie
Wave rock like Atlantic, froze like Atlantic
Party at the Sphinx, damn that's so outlandish (Straight up)

Dropped out, got signed, got mom house all in the same year (Straight up)
Don't you come around, we ain't got the time, B, naww (Straight up)
Watch me do the Randy, touchdown (Bricks)
Knew how much I get, think La Flame the golden child (La Flame)
Ridin' right behind her, pull up beside her (Skrt)
We poppin' champagne, damn you apple cider

Pull out the zip, pull out the ride (Roll out)
We so high, upper echelon (Straight up)
We so fuckin' high, I'm upper echelon (Damn! Aight, Travis, let get it, Hustle Gang, nigga!)

Pull out the zip, pull out the ride (Roll out, bando)
We so high, I'm upper echelon (Bando, straight up)
We so fuckin' high, I'm upper echelon (Bando, damn, 2 Chainz)

Pull out the zip, pull out the ride (Roll out, Bando)
We so high, I'm upper echelon (Bando, straight up)
We so fuckin' high, I'm upper echelon (Bando, damn!)
