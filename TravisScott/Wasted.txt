Wasted or nah?
(Aw, aw, yeah, aw)
Are you wasted or nah? Wasted or nah? Wasted or nah?

Take a sip, drowning in this shit, coppers on my hip, I hold my head
I've been taking risks to make that money flip, shots to the head
I ain't order it, I can't afford this shit
Go to war with this you overboard, I'm over bored with shit
Now, it's pay up player, pay a nigga
Gotta day to day to stack and still I pay accountants
Twenty racks to show just a little allowance
Only come to Houston if the boy allow it
Bow your head to a real one, coming down with them main niggas
H-Town, don't play with us, them wit-it boys stay wit-wit-wit it
I've been grinding, slaving over time since I was a fan
Looking in the mirror like "One day, Jacques, you gon' be the man"
One skinny, tatted nigga, blunt flicker
Young La Flame, hot spitter who can't hold his liquor, yah

There's a lot of motherfuckers that can't handle they liquor
Can't handle these drugs
Wasted or nah?
It's only real niggas that can handle their shit, man
Wasted or nah?
Yeah (Wasted or nah?)
So, if you tryna get lit, wanna pour up?
Make sure you stay on our level, 'cause we go up
Let me see you up
