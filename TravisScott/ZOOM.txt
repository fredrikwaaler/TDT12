Gotta stay down, you ain't got no zoom
Big rock, diamonds, Yao Ming yoom (Yeah)
Purple lemonade, puffin' out them fumes
Heatin' up like last day in June (Ha)
Niggas stealin' my drip, that shit ain't cool
See, Eliantte let me polish my jewels
I cherish her face, I pay for her groom (Yeah)
No time to waste so I'm takin' off soon
Cash out on drip, tryna fly to the moon'
Lookin' like, "Who is he?" Gunna no runner, he move like me, yeah
Got foreigns, a movin' fleet, tote choppers like "Who is security?"
I fly her right in, then meet up at the room
She don't know your name, but she know all my tunes
I pass it to Los, and he shot it to Junes
You can't try none the brothers, the brothers try you (Yeah)
