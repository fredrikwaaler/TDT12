Don't like what I saw
This life without yours
Despite I was lost
Despite you got flaws
Just let our love play, its course
Let you tell it, what's mine is yours, what's yours is yours
All the signs I ignored
I play love like a sport

Yeah, first date
You ain't on time, you were late (Yeah!)
When you around me, you're safe (Lit!)
You can't go off of a hearsay
I know that look on your face
You think you winnin' a race
You think all I do is play (Yeah!)
I didn't put you in your place
Then why you still here in my place?
Yeah, thought so, yeah, and also
You think too much, we all know
You think too much, we all know
Yeah, I ain't tryna go back to war with your morals (Yeah!)
You can't kill the vibe, it's immortal (Straight up!)
I ain't buyin' it even though I can afford ya (Ooh)
'Cause I know-

Don't like what I saw (Don't like what I saw)
This life without yours (This life without yours, ooh)
Despite I was lost (Despite I was lost, ooh)
Despite you got flaws (Ooh)
Just let our love play its course (Yeah!)
Let you tell it (Ooh)
What's mine is yours, what's yours is yours (Ooh)
All the signs I ignored (Ooh)
I play love like a sport (Ooh, yeah!)

This love won't grow 'less we find growth
Wipe down your nose, girl
Won't you come over?
Let's both find hoes
Let's fuck them both
But you think too hard, we all know
You think too hard, we all know
So say nothin', nothin'
'Cause you think too hard, we all know
Yeah, you know I'd rather lead it than follow
You and me, baby, mano y mano (It's lit)
'Cause I know, I know-

Don't like what I saw (Yeah)
This life without yours (Yeah, yeah)
Despite I was lost (Ayy)
Despite you got flaws (Ayy)
Just let our love play its course (Ohhh)
Let you tell it
What's mine is yours, what's yours is yours (All is yours)
All the signs I ignored (Uh, huh)
I play love like a sport (Like a sport, no, yeah)
