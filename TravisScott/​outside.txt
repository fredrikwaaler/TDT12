Ain't goin' in, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, automatic, yeah
Always got it on me baby, automatic, yeah
Where I'm at is static, but it ain't got traffic, yeah
Push up on me, them boys make you do a backflip
Balance on the beam, yeah, balance on the beam, yeah

While they home on they homescreens

And all my niggas outside
Ain't goin' in, yeah
We been hangin' outside
Ain't goin' in

We been hangin' outside, goin' in
Outside, not goin' in
Pull up in a Lambo or just with the Benz
Checking out, never checking in
We been outside, not goin' in
Hope you had a mattress when you sleepin' on me
Hope you got some backup if you creepin' on me
'Cause just last week I Rest In Peace'd a homie
Why you do it? Why you switch up? (Ooh)
Was it for the image or for the pictures? (Ooh)
You always seem to show up when I'm at the mixes
'Cause you know I'm not myself when I'm off the liquor
Off the lean, it's always better off the lean

All my niggas outside
Ain't goin' in, yeah
We been hangin' outside
Ain't goin' in
All my niggas outside (21, 21, 21, 21)
